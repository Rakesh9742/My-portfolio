            <h4>1.In Metal Deposition and Additive Manufacturing: Bridging Theory and Practice at ASME</h4> 
            <p>The utilization of memory foam as an
                inner lining material for vehicles
                through 3D printing technology
                represents a breakthrough in
                automotive interior design. Traditional
                vehicle interior materials
                have limitations in terms of customization,
                adaptability, and passenger
                comfort. Memory foam, with its unique viscoelastic properties, offers a
                solution to these challenges. By combining it with the precision
                of 3D printing, the potential for tailored customization reaches new heights.</p>
            
            <h4>2.Presented research paper in Aakaar, IIT Bombay 16th edition on Augmented and Virtual Reality for Architectural
                Visualization.</h4>
                <p>In the realm of architecture and engineering, the integration of virtual reality (VR) and 
                    augmented reality (AR) has revolutionized design. This technological advancement enables architects 
                    and engineers to craft immersive 3D models, offering profound insights into structural performance. 
                    Leveraging spatial mapping and gesture recognition, professionals can identify stress areas and address 
                    potential issues before physical construction, resulting in significant time and cost savings.</p>
