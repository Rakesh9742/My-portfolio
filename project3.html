            <h1>Predictive maintenance (XAI)</h1>

            <p>Predictive maintenance is a process that utilizes machine-learning models to predict equipment failure or maintenance needs, thus enabling proactive interventions and optimizing operational costs. However, these models often lack transparency and act as "black boxes" that provide predictions without explanation. This opacity hinders trust, safety, and compliance, especially in critical applications, such as manufacturing, aviation, and energy. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are designed to address this challenge by enhancing the interpretability and transparency of machine-learning models and providing insights into their decision-making processes</p>
            <h2>RESULTS</h2>
            <P>The incorporation of Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies in predictive maintenance improves the transparency and interpretability of machine learning models in critical applications. Techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and visual methods like PDP and ICE plots enhance the comprehension of model predictions and vital influencing factors, providing actionable insights and fostering trust and compliance in sectors like manufacturing, aviation, and energy.</P>
